# [Project 6 SQL Projects](https://github.com/briankurniawan/SQL-Accounting-Project-BK)
1. Finance Accounting Project USING Accounting Data Base of a company, student have to build a P&L and B/S Statement using SQL Code There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but I decided to focus on creating formula for each calendar year

2. School Data base and Netflix Data Base I have the opportunity to learn more about SQL using School Data Base and Netflix Data base

School Data Base: With total of 8 tables/Primary Key, I was able to create multiple query to identify some of the most common question regarding student activity in school, class enrollment, grades, degree, campus, academic year, and program.

Netflix Data Base: Netflix uses multiple data point to manage and track the activity of their user. One of the most important variables is to identify which specific film/genre that the user have like or add to their list. Netflix does not promote reviews or rating for their movies, however, this activity could indicates that some genre is more popular for certain individual, or we could provide suggestion on movies with similar genre, artist, country, or show type.
