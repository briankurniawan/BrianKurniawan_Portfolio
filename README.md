On this project, I was assigned to work with a cosmetic and beauty manufacturing company where they have the following goals
1. They want to optimize the revenue using the limited raw material.
2. They want to source out the manufacturing capability to other company to reduce cost and fullfil high demand.

With 12 variable constraints and real time information,
we have to analyze how the company could maximize their profit and meet demand at the same time.

# [Project 6 SQL Projects with Stored Procedure](https://github.com/briankurniawan/SQL-Accounting-Project-BK)
1. Finance Accounting Project USING Accounting Data Base of a company, student have to build a P&L and B/S Statement using SQL Code There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but I decided to focus on creating formula for each calendar year

2. School Data base and Netflix Data Base I have the opportunity to learn more about SQL using School Data Base and Netflix Data base

School Data Base: With total of 8 tables/Primary Key, I was able to create multiple query to identify some of the most common question regarding student activity in school, class enrollment, grades, degree, campus, academic year, and program.

Netflix Data Base: Netflix uses multiple data point to manage and track the activity of their user. One of the most important variables is to identify which specific film/genre that the user have like or add to their list. Netflix does not promote reviews or rating for their movies, however, this activity could indicates that some genre is more popular for certain individual, or we could provide suggestion on movies with similar genre, artist, country, or show type.


# [Project 7 Data Visualization with Tableau](https://github.com/briankurniawan/Tableau-Data-Visualization-BK/blob/main/README.md)
(https://data.gov.sg/dataset/graduate-employment-survey-ntu-nus-sit-smu-suss-sutd) From online data base source provided by the government, I have to focus on two important variables on detemrining how successful is a school and a program within school. Monthly salary and employement rate are the two most signifacnt indicators on this project, with data from 700 students from 2014-2018, I have to provide deeper analysis why NUS is better than the other University.

#[Project 8 Marketing Data Visualization with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/brian.kurniawan#!/vizhome/BrianKurniawanDataVisualizationFinalProject/BrianKurniawanSuperstoreProject)
With sales over at 49 states and 17 products in their catalog, Superstore has to decide how their marketing campaign will be structured and implemented. There are some challenges from this analysis, with the goals to sell product to 49 states, some products provide significantly low margin rate compare to other. The company have to use the opportunity of selling high margin items that will contribute on higher sales. The next problem is selling product to 49 states create huge overhead cost for the company. People who ordered small quantity of items in small town in the United States will cost the company more shipping and operation fees. The company have to target and group some of the smaller customer to create more efficient operating cost.
